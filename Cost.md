# The Cost of Happiness
---


Today at the pool was nothing short of amazing. Today is the reason I came back. To start the day off Mrs. Ellington was overtly kind and gracious, surprising me by calling me by name and striking conversation about my future as a college student. She expressed her sincere thanks for the work I had done all Summer, and she let me know how much she wished for me to come back next season. She left a gift on the guard table, it wasn't much, just a box of peanut M&M's with a sticky note that read 'Good Job, Thanks', but it really is the thought that counts. She even started harping on Liam, telling him that he'd do good to take notes and to learn a thing or two from me if he ever had any hopes of running the pool when I was gone. So that felt nice. It's funny, in years past I always considered this to be a thankless job, one where I'd spend hours at the pool after closing making sure everything was looking up to snuff, only to come in the next day and not even hear a word about it, for everyone to just continue on as if the pool were always so clean. Which was incredibly frustrating. But this year it's different. Time after time, all Summer long I have been told of how nice of a job I have been doing, or how great the pool seems to be looking overall this Summer. I don't really know why this is the case, but it's a change that I can certainly get used to.


Then, later that day Cody shows up when Liam and I are literally sitting under the breezeway doing nothing. And to make matters worse, Liam was laying in a lounge chair which he had pulled off the deck and was watching Netflix on his phone. To my surprise, Cody seemed like he didn't care at all. Granted these are the last couple days he will be working for Swim Metro for the rest of his life (maybe) but still, what went down was a little out of character, IMO. This fact is yet another motivator for me to return next year. I would love to know what it would be like to manage the pool where Cody is not my boss.



After a couple more empty hours at the pool, Ella and Ms. Maltby showed up, preparing the pool for the party to come. Having been so moved by the acts of Mrs. Ellington earlier in the morning I decided that if I wanted that photo to memorialize this Summer, then I was going to have to act. And I did. I got her to send me the photo and felt only a little embarrassed, but to hell with all that, because I am just glad that if this really is it, then I will at least have something to remember it by.



Eventually, everyone else showed up, except the ones I really was hoping for, and the evening turned out to be incredibly fun. They paid us to stay until 9 pm (first time all Summer baby) and it was the easiest $50 I've made in my life. We let the kids break the rules (within reason) and I promised that anyone who could climb up the slide from the well would get a free snow cone. I had so much fun helping those kids get up the slide, for the first time I think I really let all my inhibitions down with those kids and just didn't give a shit about making a fool out of myself. I let myself act more like a kid than I have in a long time. And it was great. I always knew that acting more like a kid makes kids respond better to you, I see it with Justin all the time, but I was always too afraid to try. I now realize there is no trying, if you are ever ingenuine for an instant they'll see right through it, or rather they will think you are weird. By just allowing myself to just interact with them as if we were friends and worked to accomplish goals and have fun together I didn't have to try to be anything. Tonight when I was trying so hard to get Ella up the slide in order for her to earn her snowcone I remember being so frustrated with the fact that she kept letting go of the rope I was trying to use to pull her up the slide. Even at the moment, this was a little strange to me; I was feeling this frustration for Ella as if the fact that her being a kid were irrelevant. I guess what was weird is how she made me feel this emotion the same way an adult or person my age would, so I had to repeatedly remind myself, 'she's just a kid'. By not giving a shit and just having fun with them I gained their trust. They let me help them climb the slides, they wanted me to play the jail game with them in the adult pool, and they began interacting with me in the same way the Long kids do and for the most part, always have. Every kid at the pool tonight made me realize just how ignorant I have been, they proved to me that all of them are just as cool as anyone else. I realized how much fun Audrey and Harrison can be once they decide to talk to you. All of them. Claire is sassy but quirky and funny if she decides to you're worthy of being liked. All these kids and experiences have taught me invaluable lessons this Summer.



Aside:

One thing that annoys me a bit is how much Hayden has seemingly changed in the past year. Last Summer I remember him Zac and Daniel spending hours pretending to be operatives, spies, or cops and running around the deck with guns, or sailing their toy boat from the window in the kitchen which they called HQ. I don't remember him or the other kids being so eager to go home all the time. It's funny because that's how I was back when I was addicted to Overwatch and now I see how much of a buzzkill it is to everyone else enjoying their time. It also pisses me off that the Long's do this so frequently, like that one Saturday a couple of weeks ago where not even like 40 minutes after arriving Mrs. Long was asking her kids if they wanted to go (granted they did just try out for year-round swimming, but still) and it just tore me apart. It was literally my saving grace, a source of great happiness after such a depressing week and it was being pulled away almost as quickly as it came. It was only by a stroke of luck that caroline decided to stay and the rest of the evening was incredibly delightful, but then the next day she didn't even feel like showing up so her mom didn't make her. This is all fine, it just makes me see how different the cultures that I grew up in and the one that these kids have grown up in really are. It's also funny because it is totally like me to just want to stay at home and play on my computer, or not do anything and a major reason I cite for liking the Long's is how similar they are to me in personality, so this type of behavior is to be expected, however, I'm still no less pissed off that it does happen. This is also another reason I really wanted to babysit them because it would shed even more light on just how similar we actually are.



    Then the inevitable struck and it was time to go. They all thanked us profusely, paid us handsomely and were on their way. They wasted no time in letting us know how badly they wanted us back next year. I even think this whole experience has convinced Liam to work at Founders next Summer. It just hurt to have to say goodbye, it pains me to tell them that I am probably not coming back even though I want to. This pool is my home, those kids, the lifeguards, the parents, they are all my family, and it really hurts to have to go. They want me back, I want me back, everybody wants me back. But for some reason, I can't go back. I really have to do a lot of soul searching and logistics before I know for sure what I want for myself, but as of right now what makes me happy is working at the pool and I choose happiness over wealth any day of the week. I also realize that I make that statement from a position of luxury and privilege. I am only able to hold this job and not be in financial ruin because I am still fully dependent on my parents. My future is hard to ignore. I am quite certain that I can still be successful in life without having a Summer internship next year, however, I don't know if I should make that bet. I'd have to get recertified, which would be a royal pain in the butt. Also, I'm pretty sure I would disappoint my mother greatly, or at the very least shock her. But next Summer is my last. My last Summer ever. Next Summer is my last Summer as a student ever. The end of my student career. The summer after graduation kind of counts, but there is a lot of expectation that I will have a job with a salary that will start sometime in the Summer. Plus, the summer after next marks the first Summer Hayden Lear is eligible to be a Lifeguard, and although I'm not certain he'll actually be one I still feel like the beginning of his potential lifeguarding career should mark the end of my realized one.



It's just such horse shit to have to not come back despite literally everyone at the pool wanting me back as well as myself desperately wanting nothing more than to go back. But I'll have to get recertified and that's a pain in the ass, (but it would be totally worth it) so I don't know. There are certainly some barriers to entry, but overall I think it would be worth it to come back as far as my happiness goes. These times are unique to the current era of my life and will only ever happen now. This is the final opportunity to have these experiences. I cannot simply brush my feelings aside and say, 'don't worry, another chance will come up again at some point in your life', because I really don't know what lies ahead. What goes on at Founder's is an anomaly even among pools and is the reason so many new guards have come and stayed. It is the reason Liam might come back. Also, I'd love to work with Liam more, for him to be assistant manager would be kind of cool and I really enjoy working with him, and I know he would be a fantastic addition to the Founders Bridge staff. But I digress. Next summer is my last and I'd much rather spend it making more money and memories working at the easiest pool in the world surrounded by the people whom I care about the most.

   

    I also don't like how this decision doesn't really feel like its mine to make, and I guess really it's not. My parents are heavily invested in my future and as such the effects of any decision I make will be felt by them in the long run. However, if I feel that I can make just as good a case for myself to be hired out of college by doing Open Source development then I will more seriously consider coming back to the pool for one last Summer. 

What a fucking bass-ackwards world we live in. At the beginning of the Summer going back to work at the pool was my definition of failure, I was depressed about the outcome of the cloud bees internship and hung my head low at the realization that I was going to have to go back, a realization which I was willfully ignorant of and was desperately putting off until the bitter end. I came back to the pool feeling spiteful and vowed I wouldn't take the job seriously. And boy did they knock me off my high horse. Success is a matter of perspective, the problem is my mother and I now see my future from a different point of view.



Now, for the last time.

    Tomorrow is it. My last day at the pool probably ever. Does it really have to go? I know at some point it must be gone, like all things. However, it just feels too early. Like there is more story to be told from a book which is already closing. 



    I'm tired again, not sure what else I wanted to write about but I know there was more. That's something school can't do for me, sleep. I haven't slept better than I do now in ages. Working at that pool really takes it out of me and as a result, my sleep is amazing and comes easy.
